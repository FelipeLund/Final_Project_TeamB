The three ideas that should produce results are:

1. Temperature for every day of the year (with error bars)

2. Length of seasons (fit with sinusoidal)

3. Hottest or coldest temperature per year



First Steps Neded:

1. Clean smhi files into easily-parsable csv files 
2. Store clean files in clean_datasets folder
3. Find functions to parse through csv


Functions Needed for Result 1:
- Exract temperature for specific day of the year
- Create histogram
- Define error bars and include them in histogram


Functions Needed for Result 2:
- Extract temperature for all days in year
- Create histogram
- Sinusoidal fitting
- Distancea between sinusoidal peaks (should be easy to see from fit)


Functions Needed for Result 3:
- Get daily temperatures for a given year
- Find maximum
- Plot over time
