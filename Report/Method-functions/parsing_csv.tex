The code is structured in a way such that the results are produced in a file called project.cpp. This main function (called just 'project' in this case) makes use of the headers 'parse\_csv.h' and 'tempTrender.h' which are contained in the /include directory. The tempTrender header contains a class called tempTrender where an object is initialized by passing in a filename containing weather data as a parameter. The member functions tempOnDay, max/minOverTime, and avgDailyTempOverTime act on the object by parsing through the csv, extracting the data, processing it, and then plotting it using ROOT libraries. To parse through the csv Ben Strasser's Fast C++ CSV Parser (\url{https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser}) was used by cloning the github repository into an directory called ./external/include. With this library one could quickly go through every line of the csv file and extract information depending on the Result one is looking to create.
