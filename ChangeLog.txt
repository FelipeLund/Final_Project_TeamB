[26-10-21] Created a GitHub repository, set up a file structure, and added some main files.

[27-10-21] Created a Make-file and prepared for implementation of csv-parser. Put together a data-cleaner bash script.

[28-10-21] Updated all the city files(removed unwanted commas). Made sure csv.h parser functions work and extraction for info of daily temperature function (result1) is ready. Started to look into root plotting hists. Thing to do for tomorrow: open ROOT and run the .cpp file.

[29-10-21] Separated the functions we have tested in main into their respective .h and .cpp files in the include/ and src/ directories. Function that returns vector of max temperature for each year (result 3) is ready. 


[29-10-21] The three that provide the data that will be used to create the plot of the results are ready. We will make it so that one can initialize a tempTrender object (lets call it lund) in root by giving a filepath. Then with lund.tempOnDay(int day, int month) then it would run all functions to fetch the data and then plot a histogram.
