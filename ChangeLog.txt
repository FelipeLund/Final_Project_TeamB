[dd-mm-yy]
[26-10-21] Created a GitHub repository, set up a file structure, and added some main files.

[27-10-21] Created a Make-file and prepared for implementation of csv-parser. Put together a data-cleaner bash script.

[28-10-21] Updated all the city files(removed unwanted commas). Made sure csv.h parser functions work and extraction for info of daily temperature function (result1) is ready. Started to look into root plotting hists. Thing to do for tomorrow: open ROOT and run the .cpp file.

[29-10-21] Separated the functions we have tested in main into their respective .h and .cpp files in the include/ and src/ directories. Function that returns vector of max temperature for each year (result 3) is ready. 


[29-10-21] The three that provide the data that will be used to create the plot of the results are ready. We will make it so that one can initialize a tempTrender object (lets call it lund) in root by giving a filepath. Then with lund.tempOnDay(int day, int month) then it would run all functions to fetch the data and then plot a histogram.
A create_hist()-function was also implemented; when called with a vector as input, it prints the histogram corresponding to the data in given vector.

[30-10-21] Moved around histogram function to correct file, and added plotting functionality to all functions. Fixed some variable declarations that was in conflict with the plotting.

[31-10-21] Updated the cleaning script. Made the files look cleaner and added additional comments. All the CleanCity.csv files to be used are also stored in code/ClnData for easier access. 

[01-11-21] Tried to create a function that finds the indices of all years' max temp. Also instead of plotting in a graph only the highest temperatures over the years, also plot the coldest temperatures will be made (similar to 3.3 in the project description manual). 
Added a function in parse_csv.cpp that will allow to get index of the temperature in a vector.

[02-11-21] A function Day_MaxDailyAvgTemp_Year has been created which gets the dates for the max average temperature per year.
